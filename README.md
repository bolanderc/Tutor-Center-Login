# ENGR Tutor Center Login

This project is the main data analysis tool used by the Utah State University College of Engineering Tutor Center. It was created in an effort to write the login system using a modern language interface (Python). Using this system is as simple as opening the TCLogin.py file and running it using a Python 3 compiler. **Note that the login will not work in a Python 2 environment.

Changes to TCLogin.py should be restricted to necessary updates to course names and majors, though the intent of the documentation was to make it easy to update the GUI as necessary.

## Notes

This login system was intended for use in the USU CoE Tutor Center Only.

## Documentation

See doc strings in code.

## Installation

Simply extract the contents of the TutorCenterLogin.zip
file and run the TCLogin.py script.
